# Marriage_app_version_2

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to help general people for their merrage partner finding.
A person who is not able to tell his parents about his merrage or he have no ability 
to find a parner directly this app is for him/her. Finding a parner for marrage is not easy today.
People haven't enough time to explore whole country and find his desirable person in traditional way.
This is a waste of time. To overcome the problem this application comes up. Using this app anyone can:

Find his\her desirbale person
Can upload his\her profile
Can propose a person
Can choose a persona by observing various thinks like height, age , face color etc


##The Technology Used in This Project
The database is designed using Django and SQLite.
A RESTFULL API is made for profile making of a person. 
Using the django REST framework it was possible.
There are many web pages here. All of them are made by using Bootstrap library.
The basic structure of the web pages are made by HTML,CSS. Making the web pages mobile friendly is a challenge.
Bootstrap library helped me to make the task easy. Therefore custom CSS was also required for making the pages attractive and nice looking.
The whole project was bulid up using Visual Stutio Code Editor. The project was run in a virtual environemnt.
