# Marriage Partner Finding Application (Django)

## Short Description
This application will help a person to get their desired person for marriage easily. A  person can search the types of person he or she likes and view the details
of the person. If he likes any person he can propose to that person by using this app. On the other hand, he can create his own  profile in the portal so that
if any person likes his profile that person can propose or contact him.
## Goal:
The goal of this project is to help general people for their marriage partner finding.
A person who is not able to tell his parents about his marriage or has no ability 
to find a partner directly this app is for him/her. Finding a partner for marriage is not easy today.
People haven't enough time to explore the whole country and find the desirable person in the traditional way.
This is a waste of time. To overcome the problem this application comes up. Using this app anyone can:
<br>

*Find his or her desired person <br>
*Can upload his or her profile <br>
*Can propose a person<br>
*Can choose a persona by observing various things like height, age, face color, etc<br>
<br>

## The Technology Used in This Project
The database is designed using Django and SQLite.
A RESTFUL API is made for the profile making of a person. 
Using the Django REST framework it was possible.
There are many web pages here. All of them are made by using the Bootstrap library.
The basic structure of the web pages is made of HTML and CSS. Making the web pages mobile-friendly is a challenge.
Bootstrap library helped me to make the task easy. Therefore custom CSS was also required for making the pages attractive and nice looking.
The whole project was built up using Visual Studio Code Editor. The project was run in a virtual environment.
